## Introduction

### Description of the Paper

The aim of the paper was to examine different approaches concerning handling design weights in multilevel models when analyzing large-scale assessments such as TIMSS. The authors examined real data from two countries (US and Sweden) and included a simulation study. Three types of two-level models were used in the empirical and simulation studies; the student model, full model, and null model for reference purposes.

### Justification of the Choice

I decided to take this paper because multilevel modeling is very important in my field so I want very much to learn. Also, I am interested in large scale assessments so TIMSS data would be ideal to examine and understand multilevel models and the weighting process. So if I reproduce this paper I will learn how to reproduce articles, weighting process of multilevel models, conducting multilevel analysis, and will be able to explore TIMSS data.  

### What is being reproduced?

For the purpose of this course, I plan to do only the empirical study (omitting the simulation study). However, I will do my best to try to do the simulation study as well if I feel I can.

### Procedure and Challenges

The TIMSS data are publically available data so I have an access to the data in these two countries. I need to use the authors' proposed methods and analyze based on their three models and see whether my conclusions are the same as the authors.

There are many challenges in doing this. First, I know very little about multilevel modeling and how to do it with programming languages. It is going to be a very challenging task; however, I am very motivated to do this so I am hoping that I will be successful. In addition, the TIMSS dataset is a huge dataset and I will need to handle it.
